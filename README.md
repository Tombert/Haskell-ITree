# Haskell Interaction Trees

(Until I can think of a more interesting name).  

## What is this? 

Interaction Trees are a pretty cool data structure, gaining a fair amount of traction in the formal methods space.  [Here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00046) is a paper on them.

This project exists as a Haskell-first port of the [Isabelle version of Interaction Trees](https://github.com/isabelle-utp/interaction-trees). If you follow that link, you will find references to more literature on Interaction Trees and their utility. 

The aim of this project is so bring the power of interaction trees to Haskell as a generic library.
